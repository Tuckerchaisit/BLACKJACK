### Overview

Games resembling blackjack have been around since the 15th century, but the main predecessor of the modern-day casino favorite was a 17th-century game known as “Venti-Un.” Just like blackjack, the objective in this game was to get as close as possible to 21 without going over, and aces were worth either 1 or 11 points.
