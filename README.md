### Overview

Games resembling blackjack have been around since the 15th century, but the main predecessor of the modern-day casino favorite was a 17th-century game known as “Venti-Un.” Just like blackjack, the objective in this game was to get as close as possible to 21 without going over, and aces were worth either 1 or 11 points.

How to: The basic of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, without going over 21. Other players at the table are of no concern. Your hand competes only against the hand of the dealer.An Ace can count as either 1 or 11. The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.The 10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.
